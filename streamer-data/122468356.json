Started late because I:\n- repotted my plants\n- put the cake on (cheesecake)\n- cooled the cake\n- finished the cake\n- had dinner\n- did all the dishes\n- spoke to my Mumsie\n\nThen we got into the game finally. Lots of talks tonight about tax since tax time is coming up. Playing by myself for most of the night then we had some peeps come join us. Mainly did a dungeon, then started doing more bosses for the weekly rewards.\n\nThere was also a lot of talk about relationships, would I be jealous or not, prenuptial agreements, guys chasing me for my food, guys chasing girls, me liking Disney... etc. By this point Duke came in and was super confused!\n\nWe also talked about getting a career in tech, inspiration for others, and what you're working on.","created_at":"2021-07-05T05:28:11Z","published_at":"2021-07-05T05:28:11Z","url":"https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1077101249","thumbnail_url":"https://static-cdn.jtvnw.net/cf_vods/d2nvs31859zcd8/ecaf660d4710852e2a6c_mishmanners_73135690879_2151723787/thumb/custom-eedb00d8-8d7a-49ca-86c8-f5748ec83c90-%{width}x%{height}.jpeg","viewable":"public","view_count":0,"language":"en","type":"highlight","duration":"2h26m43s","muted_segments":null}}
